Room Occupancy Monitoring System tracks room entry/exit using ultrasonic sensors, ESP32, and a seven-segment display. It updates real-time occupancy and sends WhatsApp alerts via CallMeBot when limits are exceeded. Includes code, flowchart, and setup instructions for easy implementation in managing room capacity efficiently.
